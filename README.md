# Sail-the-Void
Nowhere near done, yet we're farther than ever before.
Built off Origins, by Monokiro. The simplest ruleset I could find, and a great place to start my own journey into creating rulesets.

# My Goal:

There will be a world of madness, where there sits void where ocean would be on any sane world. 
Only Flux separates landmass from Void. It is unsafe to embark on the Flux for too long without returning to land or braving the Void.
The land is no better. Cities can barely stave off hunger or thirst with what little there is here.
There exists exotic resources that could potentially provide for us, as both food and as tools to thrive.

There are only two goals:
Find the truths through meditations. 
Meditation on the natural world we find ourselves in through research and discovery,
Meditation on the society we exist within, through developing our culture and enacting policies to benefit us,
Meditation and communion with those we submit ourselves to, through faith and our beliefs.

All three combined will give us the opportunity to exit this monsterous place.

Or

We can plunder, steal, feed. On those we conquer, we shall enact our will. 
And Dominate this plane, and become one with the Chain

My goal is to make this dream a reality. It will take a long time, due to life and inexperience.

But I wish to develop and deliver an experience to the Unciv Community
